# coinsorter
This device purpose is to increase convenient in separation and coins counting, showing amount and value of coins.

This device is consist of these 2 components.

### #1 Device base!
We couldn't figure what is the best for device base so we have 2 base.

First one

These are for sorting coin to specific hole for each coin.

### #2 Device system!

The device system is basically Arduino system inside of the base for detect coins and counting them so we can show amount of coins and value of coins on LCD 16x2.

The circuit is basically look like this.

[This is code for this circuit](main.ino)

## To conclude this is basically all the thing about this project hope you enjoy.
